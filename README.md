# MaelstromCore

This is the experimental branch of Maelstrom Core, i.e where all code will be put before it is finalized by myself and the rest of the Dev team. I'm not going to explain the file structure for this, as it closely matches the master branch and will be constantly changing as new features are added. If you are here to help work on the project, I suggest cloning the master branch instead of this one, as it provides a more solid example of programming style and practice that will eventually go into the plugin. In short, this branch is going to be very messy and confusing.
